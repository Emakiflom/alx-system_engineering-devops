# 0x07. Networking basics #0

This project covers the foundational concepts of networking, including the OSI model, types of networks (LAN and WAN), Internet basics, IP addresses, and protocols (TCP and UDP). The learning objectives span various aspects of networking, ensuring a solid understanding of key principles.

## Resources

- [WAN network](link-to-wan-network)
- [Internet](link-to-internet)
- [MAC address](link-to-mac-address)
- [What is an IP address](link-to-ip-address)
- [Private and public address](link-to-private-public-address)
- [IPv4 and IPv6](link-to-ipv4-ipv6)
- [Localhost](link-to-localhost)
- [TCP and UDP](link-to-tcp-udp)
- [TCP/UDP ports List](link-to-tcp-udp-ports-list)
- [What is ping / ICMP](link-to-ping-icmp)
- [Positional parameters](link-to-positional-parameters)
- **man or help:**
  - `netstat`
  - `ping`
