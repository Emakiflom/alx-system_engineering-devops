# 0x0B. SSH

This repository contains solutions to the SSH project for Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding servers, SSH, creating SSH RSA key pairs, and connecting to remote hosts using SSH RSA key pairs.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
