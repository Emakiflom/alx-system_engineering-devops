## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- How to draw a diagram covering the web stack built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- What each component of the web stack is doing
- System redundancy
- Acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding, take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed
- Upload a screenshot showing that you completed the required levels to any image hosting service
- Insert the link of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff, or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
