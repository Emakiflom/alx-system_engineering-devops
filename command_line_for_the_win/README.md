   - Save the screenshots inside the directory: `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`

2. **Open Terminal:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

3. **Connect to Sandbox Environment:**
   - Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment.
   - Command: `sftp username@hostname`
   - Enter the password when prompted.

4. **Navigate to Directory:**
   - Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
   - Command: `cd /path/to/sandbox/directory`

5. **Upload Screenshots:**
   - Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
   - Command: `put local_screenshot.png`
   - Repeat for each screenshot.

6. **Confirm Transfer:**
   - Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
   - Command: `ls`

7. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

8. **Documentation:**
