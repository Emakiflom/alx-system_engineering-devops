# Network Security with Firewalls

This repository contains information and resources related to network security with firewalls.

## Overview

Firewalls play a crucial role in network security by acting as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They regulate incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

## Testing Connectivity

To test connectivity between servers or services, you can use tools like telnet. Telnet helps determine if a port is open and accessible. For example, to check port 22 (SSH) on a server:

```bash
telnet server.example.com 22
```
