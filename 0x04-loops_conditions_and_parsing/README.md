- Explain how to create SSH keys
- Understand the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- Utilize `while`, `until`, and `for` loops effectively
- Implement `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` condition statements
- Master the usage of the `cut` command
- Demonstrate understanding of files and other comparison operators

## More Info

### Shellcheck

[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a tool that helps write proper Bash scripts. It provides recommendations on syntax and semantics, as well as advice on edge cases.

#### Examples:

##### Not passing Shellcheck:
